1. download tide data from HKO
2. make an excel file to store the data
3. make some button on a sheet perhaps? one for updating the data maybe and another one for plotting graphs of selected date
4. generate a result sheet to show the graph and mark down the best fishing time, mid-ebb/flood in the graph.
